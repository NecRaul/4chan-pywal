# 4chan-pywal

Generate a theme for [OneeChan](https://github.com/KevinParnell/OneeChan) (4chanX Stylescript).

**Works with `.Xresources` files generated by [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) and its forks.**

## How it works

Make sure your `colors.Xresources` file is in `~/.cache/wal/`.

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/NecRaul/4chan-pywal.git
cd 4chan-pywal
./4chan-pywal.sh
```

The file 4chanX-theme.json should now be patched and ready to import.
